##Executive Summary  
This system is designed to assist both developers and managers in the use of software that is open source or contains open source  components. Open Source Software (OSS) has grown to be a very important piece in the enterprise world and the intake of OSS is an issue that must be addressed by both parties to ensure that it is best for the company and that it is an efficient solution to a development need.  

The system accomplishes the following things: a developer can submit a software package to be checked for open source software components  and NIST vulnerabilities, a developer and a manager both have the ability to request this information directly, and a manager is able to retrieve or modify software policy. This system enables higher efficiency for the developer as it makes it faster for them to determine if certain software is usable, and it allows management to easily apply policy to the relevant software. Use of this system not only increases productivity and efficiency, but it also helps the company particpate in the OSS community which provides a social benefit.
